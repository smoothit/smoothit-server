#
# BGP routing table configuration file
#
# The configuration file uses the following file format. A single BGP 
# routing entry is represented with the following structure, where 
# <index> is an integer number starting from 1 and it indexes the
# routing entries.
#
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrPeer = <bgp4PathAttrPeer> 
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrIpAddrPrefixLen = <bgp4PathAttrIpAddrPrefixLen>
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrIpAddrPrefix = <bgp4PathAttrIpAddrPrefix>
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrOrigin = <bgp4PathAttrOrigin>
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrASPathSegment = <bgp4PathAttrASPathSegment>
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrNextHop = <bgp4PathAttrNextHop>
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrMultiExitDisc = <bgp4PathAttrMultiExitDisc>
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrLocalPref = <bgp4PathAttrLocalPref>
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrAtomicAggregate = <bgp4PathAttrAtomicAggregate>
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrAggregatorAS = <bgp4PathAttrAggregatorAS>
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrAggregatorAddr = <bgp4PathAttrAggregatorAddr>
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrCalcLocalPref = <bgp4PathAttrCalcLocalPref>
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrBest = <bgp4PathAttrBest>
# <index>.bgp4PathAttrUnknown = <bgp4PathAttrUnknown>
#
# The attributes bgp4PathAttrIpAddrPrefixLen, bgp4PathAttrIpAddrPrefix, 
# and bgp4PathAttrASPathSegment are mandatory. The other attributes are
# optional and do not have to be listed in the configuration file.
#
# Examples:
